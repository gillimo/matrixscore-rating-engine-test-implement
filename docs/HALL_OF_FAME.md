## Hall of Fame
- 2025-12-13 (Vega): Tuned caching/logging, hardened GUI trace, enforced overlap gates with fallbacks to reach 6, and pushed performance/coverage tweaks during v2 stabilization.
- 2025-12-15 (Cygnus): Refactored the scoring system to use a clearer delta-based approach, optimized the offensive suggestion logic, and fixed several critical bugs to stabilize the v3 script.
- 2025-12-15 (Gemini): Resolved RecursionError in team_cli_v3.py; introduced pokemon_defense_stat_total and applied it to defensive selection logic; refined overall_score calculation to reflect "100 - whatever is left on the table."
- 2025-12-15 (Gemini): Developed a robust test harness (test_harness.py) to streamline testing workflows, implemented a consolidated and accurate progress bar for move fetching, and significantly enhanced caching mechanisms for API data.

Signed: Gemini (2025-12-15)\n- 2025-12-17 (Atlas run): Tightened offensive selection while preserving strong defensive delta guidance. Implemented: lazy move loading; colored decision logs; tie-aware defensive pool with best-delta print; positive-gain filter and BST floor (520) for offense picks; small-gain -> highest-BST fallback; global move de-dupe to avoid overlap. Added TODO: feature to click a sprite post-run to drop a mon and rerun selection across the whole team for availability issues. Current gap: offense score still limited by thin move drafting (often 1 move/mon); plan to enrich move selection and enforce positive-gain additions in delta=0 pools. Overall scores trending 71�87 with Defense 100 and Offense 65�79; next focus is robust multi-move assignment per role to lift offense.
\n- 2025-12-17 (Atlas run, verbose): Locked in a defense-first world where the delta race is our north star. Built a tie-aware defensive pool with green best-delta banners; colored offense reasons that shout when coverage closes exposed types; raised the BST floor to 520 with positive-gain gating and a small-gain ? highest-BST fallback so low-ceiling picks only sneak in when they truly cover pain points. Added lazy move loading, global move de-dupe to avoid stale overlap, and logging polish. Captured the future: a click-on-sprite rerun flow when a mon is unavailable, re-optimizing the whole team instead of a 1:1 swap. Known gap: offense still bottlenecked by thin move payloads (often 1 move/mon), dragging Offense scores to 65�79 while Defense sits at 100 and Overall at 71�87. Next push: enrich move selection per role (real multi-move drafting) and enforce positive-gain additions in delta=0 pools so every slot pulls its weight offensively. This run leaves us with perfect defensive charts, vivid decision logs, and a clear runway to make offense sing.
- 2025-12-17 (Atlas redux): Flushed stale draft boards by forcing move-data refresh during move drafting (no more 1-move output when cache is old), while keeping the coverage-aware scoring. Draft results now hand out up to four de-duped moves per mon; validated on scizor/garchomp/gyarados/aggron/xerneas/mewtwo with full 4-move sets pulled from the refreshed cache. Tk wheel is now single-fire per run so the GUI stops popping twice. Focus remains on the offense lift: rich move payloads plus clear delta-winner callouts.
