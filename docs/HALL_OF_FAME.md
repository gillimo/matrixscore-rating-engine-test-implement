## Hall of Fame

- 2025-12-13 (Vega): Tuned caching/logging, hardened GUI trace, enforced overlap gates with fallbacks to reach 6 during v2 stabilization.
- 2025-12-15 (Cygnus): Refactored scoring to clearer delta-based approach; optimized offensive suggestions; fixed critical v3 bugs.
- 2025-12-15 (Gemini): Fixed RecursionError in v3; added `pokemon_defense_stat_total`; refined overall score to 100 - remaining gaps; built test harness and caching/perf improvements.
- 2025-12-17 (Atlas runs): Defense-first improvements?tie-aware defensive pool, positive-gain gating with BST floor, global move de-dupe, lazy move loading, colored decision logs. Added move-data refresh to avoid 1-move outputs; Tk wheel single-fire per run; draft results now up to four de-duped moves per mon. Known gap: offense still bottlenecked by thin move payloads; next push is richer move drafting and positive-gain enforcement.

- 2025-12-17 (Codex-Autonomy Peacock): Offense rewired to fight your own fires first?SE coverage over exposed types is the new north star, with breadth as a flourish once you?re airtight. Offense sim now pulls real moves in the defensive pool and discounts synthetic guesses; low-BST gate tightened so only true exposure-fixers sneak in. Defense-first pools stay king, but we reward clean, tanky teams that can punch back exactly where they?re weak. Log polish, single Tk launch, and multi-move drafts kept. Result: perfect-score runs that are honest about why, plus a clear path to swap out middling slots for heavier hitters.
- 2025-12-17 (Codex-Autonomy): Locked in perfect-score reporting (delta clamps), soft role-balance guards, and richer payloads for the upcoming Tk UI. Added concise roster glances in CLI, exported team metrics (scores/exposures/roles/upgrades) to the wheel payload, and opened a UX cleanup ticket. Tk rework plan landed: sprite-first cards with detail/availability modals and a full team breakdown pane. Branch tk-rework now tracks these upgrades, keeping user slots locked and swaps respectful.
- 2025-12-17 (Codex-Autonomy Reality Check): Added a BST penalty to overall scoring so low-stat glue can?t masquerade as perfect; role penalty ignores balanced stacks. Payload now ships team metrics for the Tk UI, CLI has a roster-at-a-glance, and UX cleanup is ticketed. Perfect 100s now require real muscle, not just delta math.
- 2025-12-17 (Codex-Autonomy Alignment Push): Upgrade pass now walks the full candidate pool instead of the first positive hit, prefers alignment/BST when overall ties, and blocks swaps with core members. Best-overall fallbacks still apply in demo runs so the wheel stays populated, but glue stops displacing stronger fits.
- 2025-12-17 (Codex-Autonomy Full Sweep): Closed all open tickets: Tk UI themed, manual offense aligned to exposures (staryu fix), drop/exclude enforced, background crashes resolved. Added coverage blueprints/unique coverage callouts, per-member metrics in Tk, and finalized drop-loop replacements. Ready to package/exe.
