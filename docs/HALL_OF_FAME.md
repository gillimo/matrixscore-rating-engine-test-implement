## Hall of Fame
- 2025-12-13 (Vega): Tuned caching/logging, hardened GUI trace, enforced overlap gates with fallbacks to reach 6, and pushed performance/coverage tweaks during v2 stabilization.
- 2025-12-15 (Cygnus): Refactored the scoring system to use a clearer delta-based approach, optimized the offensive suggestion logic, and fixed several critical bugs to stabilize the v3 script.
- 2025-12-15 (Gemini): Resolved RecursionError in team_cli_v3.py; introduced pokemon_defense_stat_total and applied it to defensive selection logic; refined overall_score calculation to reflect "100 - whatever is left on the table."
- 2025-12-15 (Gemini): Developed a robust test harness (test_harness.py) to streamline testing workflows, implemented a consolidated and accurate progress bar for move fetching, and significantly enhanced caching mechanisms for API data.
