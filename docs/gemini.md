## Agent Guidelines (v5)

Use these operating basics (all agents):
- Read `PERMISSIONS.md`, `HOW_TO_OPERATE.md`, `PRIORITIES.md`, `BUG_LOG.md`, `V2_TICKETS.md`, `CURRENT_STATE_2025-12-17.md` before changes.
- Work only in `OneDrive/Desktop/teambuilder_v5`; sign with your handle from `LOGBOOK.md`.
- Scope = code in git + tickets added by the current agent during the run (log them immediately).
- Prefer `python team_cli_v5.py` (CLI) and `python test_harness.py` for automation; logs in `logs/`.
- Append required footer to run logs (see `PERMISSIONS.md`); sign logs and docs with handle/date.
- For big edits, rewrite full file content (patch) to avoid drift; avoid brittle inline one-liners.
