## Project Vision (v5)

Goal: Reliable, explainable team builder that balances defense-first selection with strong offensive coverage and clear user feedback.

Principles
- Defense-first, then offense from the best defensive pool.
- Scores must reflect reality (no inflated gaps, overlap penalties applied) and be explainable.
- Move suggestions must cover team needs, avoid overlap, and show intent (role + key coverage).
- Logs should be concise, readable, and reliable; GUI should support rerolling unavailable picks.

Near-term outcomes
- Correct scoring (defense/offense/overall) with overlap penalties and sane headroom.
- Coverage-aware move drafting with positive-gain gating and richer payloads.
- Clear explanations for autofill and low-stat wins.
- Stable logging; GUI slot reroll.
