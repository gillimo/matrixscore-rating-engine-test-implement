# Handoff Notes (2025-12-12) Codex (prev: Nebula)

## Outstanding Work (updated 2025-12-12 by Atlas-Delta)
- Complete demo mode (`python team_cli_v2.py --demo`): seed gengar/sableye/honedge/mewtwo, autofill to 6, run full flow, auto-apply best swap in upgrade pass; scripted inputs (`next`, `done`) enabled for unattended exit; needs uninterrupted validation.
- Logging: auto-write run output (demo + interactive) to timestamped files in `logs/`; include footer `Permissions: full access to OneDrive/Desktop/teambuilder_v2 granted by user on 2025-12-12.` and sign `Atlas` on each log.
- Self-weakness handling: applied; ghost/dragon self-weak counts as 25% if STAB is present; move suggester enforces carrying that STAB. Monitor in demo.
- Docs: keep HOW_TO_OPERATE / PROJECT_VISION / METRICS in sync post-code changes; ensure demo mode and logging/permissions are documented.

## Current State (updated 2025-12-12 by Atlas-Delta)
- Naming: every operator must choose a unique handle not already present in the logbook and sign docs/logs with it.
- `--demo` runs through coverage (coverage_report crash fixed via `suggestion_buckets(...)`); scripted inputs in place; full run still pending due to prior aborts.
- Upgrade pass uses overall-uplift replacements; demo applies top swap when reached.
- `DEMO_MODE.md` and `V2_TICKETS.md` updated (self-weak, logging notes).
- System details (shell/interpreter/network/permissions) are in `SYSTEM_NOTES.md`.
- Network calls to PokeAPI required at runtime.

## Environment/Permissions
- See `SYSTEM_NOTES.md` and `PERMISSIONS.md` for authoritative environment/permission details; `logs/` folder exists; logging active.
