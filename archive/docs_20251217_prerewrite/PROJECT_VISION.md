### Ultimate Team Goal:
The ultimate goal for a team generated by this tool is to ensure that for any defensive weakness, there exists a "safe swap" Pokémon within the team that possesses a strong offensive counter. This implies:
*   **No Overlapping Weaknesses:** Minimize shared vulnerabilities across the team.
*   **Extensive Offensive Coverage:** The team collectively should be able to hit all opponent types with effective moves.
*   **Strategic Counterplay:** When a Pokémon is weak to a certain type, there should be another team member that can safely switch in and offensively pressure that threat.

### Autofill Objective:
The autofill process (including `finalize` functionality) is designed to build a strategic team by:
*   **Prioritizing Defensive Needs:** First, identify the greatest defensive need or weakness in the current team composition.
*   **Optimizing Offensive Contribution:** Then, from the pool of Pokémon that best address that defensive need, select the one that provides the most significant offensive contribution to the team.
*   **Explainable Selections:** Provide clear explanations for Pokémon selections, especially when a Pokémon with seemingly lower base stats is chosen due to its critical defensive typing or offensive coverage (e.g., a "diamond in the rough" pick).

### Scoring Principles:
*   **Accuracy and Granularity:** The scoring metrics should accurately reflect a team's defensive and offensive strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Penalties for Flaws:** The overall score should heavily penalize overlapping weaknesses (e.g., 5 points per overlap) and accurately reflect remaining defensive and offensive headroom.
*   **Achievable Perfection:** A perfect score of 100 should be achievable for a theoretically optimal team (zero defensive and offensive deltas, no overlapping weaknesses).

### UI/UX:
*   **Clear Feedback:** Provide concise and informative feedback to the user, particularly regarding autofill decisions and key team metrics.
*   **Efficient Operation:** Suppress verbose outputs (like detailed offensive suggestions) during non-interactive, automated processes (`finalize` or autofill) to keep logs clean and improve performance.
