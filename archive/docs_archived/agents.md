## Agents (DLC)

Purpose: whoâ€™s operated the project and how to sign your work.

- Current handles: Atlas, Helix, Orion, Comet, Vega, Codex, Nova, Quill, Cygnus, Gemini, Stardust.
- Register/sign in `LOGBOOK.md` before edits; sign logs and docs with handle + date.
- Entry points: `python team_cli_dlc.py` (CLI) and `python tk_team_builder.py` (GUI wheel if present).
- Scripts/logs: harness via `python test_harness.py`; logs land in `logs/run_*.log` or `logs/demo_*.log`.
- Payloads: latest team payload at `team_payload.json`; GUI reads it when available.
- Version scope: active codebase is DLC (this directory); legacy v3 is archived.
