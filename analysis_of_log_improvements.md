Here are 5 critical additions/improvements to the log to support user UX, keeping order and context in mind:

---

**1. Log Addition: Clear indication of autofill strategy for each pick**

*   **Current problem:** Each "Added X via Y" line in autofill only states the label generated by `pick_offense_addition` or `pick_overall_addition`. It doesn't explicitly mention if the pick came from the "defensive candidates pool" (which is the new core logic).
*   **Proposed addition:** When a Pokémon is added via autofill, clearly state *which stage of the autofill logic* led to its selection (e.g., "Defensive First Pick (from best defensive typing)" or "Offensive Optimization (within defensive pool)").
*   **Placement:** Immediately after the "Added X via Y" line during autofill.
*   **Example:**
    ```
    Added xerneas via Overall xerneas: 0/100 (uplift +0; def 78, off 21, stack 0, delta 64.0)
    [Autofill Strategy] Picked from a pool of defensive candidates for optimal typing.
    ```
*   **Why it's critical:** The user explicitly asked for a refactor of autofill to prioritize defensive types first, then offensive from that pool. This log message directly confirms that the new strategy is being followed for each pick, increasing transparency and trust in the algorithm's decisions.

**2. Log Addition: Summary of the "best defensive typing" identified by `get_best_defensive_candidates`**

*   **Current problem:** The `get_best_defensive_candidates` function works internally to identify the best typing, but this crucial decision is not surfaced in the log. The user doesn't see *what* the algorithm considered to be the most impactful defensive typing to add.
*   **Proposed addition:** After `[progress] Autofill iteration X (team size Y)`, if defensive candidates are identified, print a line stating the best defensive typing found and its delta.
*   **Placement:** Within `autofill_team`, before `pick_offense_addition` is called with the defensive candidates.
*   **Example:**
    ```
    [progress] Autofill iteration 1 (team size 0)
    [Autofill Logic] Identified best defensive typing to add: Fairy/Steel (delta +25)
    ```
*   **Why it's critical:** This directly supports the new autofill logic's transparency. The user can see the primary defensive decision driving the subsequent offensive pick.

---

**3. Log Addition: Detailed explanation for low-stat wins (if triggered)**

*   **Current problem:** While the "Low Stat Win" message exists, it's currently generic: "for superior offensive gain." The user specifically linked this to "critical moves" in future, but even now, a more detailed explanation of *why* the offensive gain was superior (e.g., "covers a critical weakness" or "adds unique super-effective coverage to 3 types") would be highly beneficial.
*   **Proposed addition:** Expand the "Low Stat Win" message to include a brief, specific reason if possible. This might require passing more context back from `pick_offense_addition` or `pick_overall_addition`.
*   **Placement:** The existing "Low Stat Win" line.
*   **Example:**
    ```
    [Low Stat Win] Staryu (BST: 340) chosen over Gyarados (BST: 540) for superior offensive gain: adds Electric coverage for shared Water weakness.
    ```
*   **Why it's critical:** Directly addresses user's concern about understanding *why* such a seemingly counter-intuitive choice was made. Increases trust and explainability.

**4. Log Addition: Concise summary of what was chosen for Move Suggestions**

*   **Current problem:** After "=== Draft results ===", only the move names are shown. The role and alignment score are listed per Pokémon in the "Final team summary," but a brief recap here would help the user quickly grasp the move selection.
*   **Proposed addition:** A concise line for each Pokémon in the "Draft results" section, indicating its assigned role and key move characteristic (e.g., type, STAB/coverage).
*   **Placement:** Within "=== Draft results ===", right after each Pokémon's move list.
*   **Example:**
    ```
    Xerneas: terrain-pulse
    (Role: Balanced, Key Move: Terrain Pulse - Fairy STAB)
    ```
*   **Why it's critical:** Helps the user quickly understand the strategic intent behind each Pokémon's move set, linking the "Draft results" to the detailed "Final team summary" below.

---

**5. Log Addition: Clearer initial state/goals of autofill**

*   **Current problem:** The autofill starts with `Auto-filling remaining slots...` and `[progress] Autofill iteration X (team size Y)`. There's no clear statement of the overall goal (fill to 6) or the current team's starting weaknesses/gaps that the autofill is trying to address.
*   **Proposed addition:** At the beginning of `autofill_team`, briefly state the current team state (e.g., size, major weaknesses) and the goal of the autofill.
*   **Placement:** Just after `Auto-filling remaining slots...`
*   **Example:**
    ```
    Auto-filling remaining slots...
    [Autofill Goal] Current team has 0 members and is significantly weak to Rock, Ground, and Water. Aiming to build a balanced 6-member team.
    ```
*   **Why it's critical:** Provides immediate context for the entire autofill process, setting user expectations and helping them follow the subsequent picks more effectively.
